			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

Rouch estimate of 30h per team member

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

The assignment has been a joint effort. No division of work/focus.	

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

Understanding how to work with file descriptors took a long time.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

NA

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

No

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

How and when to properly close file descriptors!

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

No

>> Any other comments?

We would really appreciate if you make lecture material available earlier. Some
like to look through the material prior to lectures which is very difficult when
it is made available sub 24h prior to the lecture.

<start of example>
Received wednesday 9:43
Take a look a X before thursday lecture 10:00
<end of eample>

These kind of things makes it really hard for us to plan our work.
